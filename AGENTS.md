### Using These Agents

- **IDE / Codex:** Run `npm exec --package bmad-drj -- bmad-method install` to sync `.bmad-core/` and this `AGENTS.md`. Codex will load this file automatically.
- **Web flows:** Upload the matching `dist/teams/team-fullstack.txt` bundle to your conversational interface for the same roster.

## DrJLabs-Specific Notes

- Releases are automated via `.github/workflows/release.yaml` and use `semantic-release`. Conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, etc.) keep versioning predictable.
- Set up the commit template once: `git config commit.template .github/commit-template.txt`.
- Publish artifacts come from the `bmad-drj` package; use `npm view bmad-drj version` to confirm deployments.
- Keep `.env`, `.env.*`, and AI scratch directories out of commits and packagesâ€”`.gitignore`/`.npmignore` already handle this, but double-check when adding new assets.
