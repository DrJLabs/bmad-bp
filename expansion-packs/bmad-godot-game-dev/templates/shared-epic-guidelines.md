# Epic Planning Guidelines for Godot Projects

When drafting the epic list across templates, ensure:

- Epics are sequential, each delivering a deployable increment.
- Early epics establish core foundations (project setup, CI, baseline mechanics).
- Later epics build on prior work and deliver player-facing value.
- Favour fewer, well-scoped epics; explain rationale when splitting work.
- Cross-cutting concerns (logging, analytics, QA) are embedded across epics rather than isolated at the end.
- Stories inside every epic remain vertical slices that a single agent can complete in one focused session.
- Document prerequisites when unavoidable and note them explicitly for planners.
