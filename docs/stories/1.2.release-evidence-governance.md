# Story 1.2: Finalize Release Evidence & Artifact Governance

## Status

- Done

## Story

**As the** release maintainer for chat-mcp-farm,
**I want** the release workflow to capture audit evidence and document artifact/versioning policies,
**so that** every automated release satisfies governance requirements without manual follow-up.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Update `docs/release-automation.md` (and cross-link from `docs/versioning-and-releases.md`) with an explicit Conventional Commit ‚Üí semantic-release version bump reference table and developer checklist confirming the rules align with the current pipeline.
2. Decide on the GitHub release artifact strategy: either confirm tarball attachments remain enabled by documenting verification steps and evidence locations, or disable the attachments and document the rollback decision; in both cases, surface the outcome and retrieval instructions in the release documentation.
3. Record outstanding audit evidence from Story 1 in `docs/bmad/focused-epics/release-governance/story-1.md` by adding the latest release Actions run ID, GitHub Release URL, dry-run log, and restricted-permission failure log entries with links into `docs/bmad/focused-epics/release-governance/evidence/`.
4. Extend the release runbook to spell out Actions log retention expectations and the required evidence capture checklist so future releases preserve run IDs and artifact links without re-reading the focused-epic story.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Add a Conventional Commit versioning matrix plus a quick validation checklist to `docs/release-automation.md`, referencing the semantic-release flow already documented in `docs/versioning-and-releases.md` (AC1).
- [x] Execute a dry-run and the next successful `main` release (or inspect the most recent one) to confirm whether tarballs are attached; update the release documentation with the decision, evidence locations, and retrieval steps, and note the final decision in the Story 1 change log for traceability (AC2).
- [x] Update `docs/bmad/focused-epics/release-governance/story-1.md` change log with the latest Actions run ID, release URL, and evidence file links immediately after the next successful `Release` workflow run, and archive supporting logs under `docs/bmad/focused-epics/release-governance/evidence/` before GitHub retention purges them (AC3).
- [x] Expand the "Evidence capture checklist" section in `docs/release-automation.md` with retention guidance, run ID capture instructions, and pointers to the evidence directory so future releases remain audit-ready (AC4).
- [x] Peer-review documentation updates to ensure links resolve and the guidance matches the release workflow behaviour (AC1‚ÄìAC4).

## Dev Notes

- **Previous Story Insights:** Story 1 delivered the GitHub-only semantic-release workflow, manifest updates, and documentation baseline, with evidence logs stored under `docs/bmad/focused-epics/release-governance/evidence/` and mitigations for permissions hardening and rollback guidance already captured. [Source: docs/bmad/focused-epics/release-governance/story-1.md#Dev Notes]
- **Release Workflow Overview:** The release pipeline runs on pushes to `main`, executes validation commands, and relies on `@semantic-release/release-notes-generator`, `@semantic-release/changelog`, and `@semantic-release/github`, while `@semantic-release/npm` prepares tarballs with publishing disabled so GitHub Releases include downloadable assets. [Source: docs/release-automation.md#How it works]
- **Evidence Expectations:** The release runbook already lists dry-run, Actions run ID, release URL, and restricted-permission failure evidence, and follow-up tasks in Story 1‚Äôs risk/test documents require those artifacts to be recorded in the story change log. [Source: docs/release-automation.md#Evidence capture checklist-story-1-ac6][Source: docs/bmad/focused-epics/release-governance/story-1-test-design.md#Follow-Up Tasks][Source: docs/bmad/focused-epics/release-governance/story-1-risk-profile.md#Follow-Up Tasks]
- **Recent Evidence Run:** Release workflow run `18019240174` (2025-09-25, workflow_dispatch on `main`) completed in 44‚ÄØs without publishing a new version (no new commits). Logs archived under `docs/bmad/focused-epics/release-governance/evidence/release-run-18019240174.log`; GitHub release `v1.0.0` confirms asset `bmad-drj-1.0.0.tgz` remains available. [Source: https://github.com/DrJLabs/bmad-bp/actions/runs/18019240174][Source: https://github.com/DrJLabs/bmad-bp/releases/tag/v1.0.0]
- **Versioning Guidance:** `docs/versioning-and-releases.md` emphasizes Conventional Commit compliance and highlights the commit template that feeds semantic-release; the new table/tooling should reference this guidance rather than redefining rules. [Source: docs/versioning-and-releases.md#üöÄ-Automated-Release-Workflow]
- **File Locations:** Release docs live in `docs/release-automation.md` and `docs/versioning-and-releases.md`; evidence artifacts belong in `docs/bmad/focused-epics/release-governance/evidence/`. Story updates should remain within `docs/bmad/focused-epics/release-governance/story-1.md` and the new Story 1.2 document.
- **Architecture Notes:** `.bmad-core/core-config.yaml` references sharded architecture files under `docs/architecture/`, but that directory is absent, so no additional architecture guidance is available for this story (document the gap if it blocks downstream agents). [Source: .bmad-core/core-config.yaml]

### Testing

- Execute `npx semantic-release --dry-run --ci false` to validate the version mapping table and capture the log for documentation cross-reference (covers REL-T1/REL-T6 expectations). [Source: docs/bmad/focused-epics/release-governance/story-1-test-design.md#Test Scenarios]
- After documentation updates, run or inspect the next `Release` workflow on GitHub Actions to confirm tarball attachments and capture the run ID plus release URL for the story change log (REL-T2 requirements). [Source: docs/versioning-and-releases.md#üõ†Ô∏è-Developer-Tips]
- Re-run the restricted-permission scenario (set workflow `permissions: contents: read`) to ensure failure evidence is regenerated if policy decisions change and the log is stored in the evidence directory (REL-T3 governance check).

### Research Summary

- Story 1.2 directly addresses outstanding audit evidence flagged in Story&nbsp;1 risk/test artifacts and the release runbook. Consolidating the evidence table in Story&nbsp;1 ensures traceability for governance reviews.
- Adding the version bump matrix in the runbook reduces friction for developers unfamiliar with semantic-release, aligning with existing guidance in `docs/versioning-and-releases.md`.
- Artifact policy must be explicit: either confirm the tarball attachments remain part of the release definition or provide rollback instructions to avoid ambiguity for downstream consumers.
- The missing architecture shard noted in the core config should be documented so implementing agents know no additional architecture references exist.

**Next Steps:** Move the story into QA planning (risk profile + test design) once the above actions are accepted.
