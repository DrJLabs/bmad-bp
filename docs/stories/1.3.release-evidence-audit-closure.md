# Story 1.3: Close Release Evidence & Governance Checklist

## Status

- Review

## Story

**As the** release maintainer for BMAD,
**I want** to finalize the release governance evidence trail and mark the epic compliance checklist complete,
**so that** every future semantic-release run remains audit-ready without reopening Story 1 follow-ups.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Update `docs/bmad/focused-epics/release-governance/story-1.md` change log with the latest `Release` workflow run ID, GitHub release URL, and direct links to the dry-run, skip, and permissions-failure logs stored under `docs/bmad/focused-epics/release-governance/evidence/`. Ensure any missing artifacts (e.g., updated dry-run output) are captured and referenced. [Source: docs/bmad/focused-epics/release-governance/story-1.md#Follow-Up Tasks][Source: docs/bmad/focused-epics/release-governance/story-1.2-risk-profile.md#Follow-Up Tasks]
2. Cross-link `docs/release-automation.md` and `docs/versioning-and-releases.md` so the Conventional Commit ‚Üí semantic-release matrix, evidence checklist, and retention guidance reference each other explicitly, reducing duplicate lookup steps. [Source: docs/bmad/focused-epics/release-governance/story-1.2-test-design.md#Follow-Up Tasks]
3. Execute a fresh semantic-release dry run (`npx semantic-release --dry-run --ci false`) and trigger the GitHub `Release` workflow on `main`, recording the resulting run ID, outcome summary, tarball decision, and log locations inside Story 1‚Äôs change log and the evidence directory. [Source: docs/bmad/focused-epics/release-governance/story-1.2-test-design.md#Follow-Up Tasks][Source: docs/release-automation.md#Evidence capture checklist-story-1-ac6]
4. Reconcile the release-governance epic checklist by marking completed items (compatibility requirements, DoD checklist, validation checklist) and noting any remaining blockers with links to collected evidence or justification.

## Dev Notes

- **Previous Story Insights:** Story 1 established the GitHub-only semantic-release workflow, while Story 1.2 focused on evidence governance and artifact policy; both left follow-ups to attach run IDs, dry-run logs, and cross-document references. [Source: docs/bmad/focused-epics/release-governance/story-1.md#Follow-Up Tasks][Source: docs/bmad/focused-epics/release-governance/story-1.2-risk-profile.md#Follow-Up Tasks]
- **Evidence Requirements:** QA artifacts call for dry-run output, permissions failure logs, and release URLs to live under `docs/bmad/focused-epics/release-governance/evidence/` with links from Story 1 change log. [Source: docs/bmad/focused-epics/release-governance/story-1.2-test-design.md#Test Scenarios][Source: docs/bmad/focused-epics/release-governance/evidence/]
- **Documentation Touchpoints:** The release runbook and versioning guide must reference each other‚Äôs matrix, checklist, and retention guidance to prevent context switching. [Source: docs/release-automation.md#Evidence capture checklist-story-1-ac6][Source: docs/versioning-and-releases.md#üöÄ-Automated-Release-Workflow]
- **Workflow Commands:** Use `npx semantic-release --dry-run --ci false` for local validation and trigger `.github/workflows/release.yaml` via GitHub Actions (`gh workflow run release.yaml --ref main`) to produce auditable logs. [Source: docs/release-automation.md#üõ†Ô∏è-Developer-Tips]
- **Evidence Directory Snapshot:** Current artifacts include `release-run-18019240174.log`, `semantic-release-dry-run-20250925.log`, and permissions failure logs; replace or append with the latest run output. [Source: docs/bmad/focused-epics/release-governance/evidence/]
- **Project Structure Notes:** `.bmad-core/core-config.yaml` references sharded architecture files (`docs/architecture/...`), but those shards are not present; no additional architectural constraints are available. Document this gap if developers request architecture references. [Source: .bmad-core/core-config.yaml]

## Testing

- `REL1.3-T1` ‚Äî Execute `npx semantic-release --dry-run --ci false`, confirm output references the GitHub plugin stack, and archive the log in the evidence directory. [Source: docs/bmad/focused-epics/release-governance/story-1.2-test-design.md#Test Scenarios]
- `REL1.3-T2` ‚Äî Trigger the GitHub `Release` workflow on `main`, verify success status, tarball decision, and capture run ID + release URL in Story 1 change log. [Source: docs/release-automation.md#üõ†Ô∏è-Developer-Tips]
- `REL1.3-T3` ‚Äî Validate that the release runbook and versioning guide cross-reference each other‚Äôs matrix/checklist sections via working anchors. [Source: docs/release-automation.md#Evidence capture checklist-story-1-ac6]
- `REL1.3-T4` ‚Äî Inspect the release-governance epic checklist to ensure completed items now link to evidence and remaining gaps are documented or waived. [Source: docs/bmad/focused-epics/release-governance/epic.md#Validation Checklist]
