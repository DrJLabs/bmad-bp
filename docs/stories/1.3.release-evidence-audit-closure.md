# Story 1.3: Close Release Evidence & Governance Checklist

## Status

- Review

## Story

**As the** release maintainer for BMAD,
**I want** to finalize the release governance evidence trail and mark the epic compliance checklist complete,
**so that** every future semantic-release run remains audit-ready without reopening Story 1 follow-ups.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Update `docs/bmad/focused-epics/release-governance/story-1.md` change log with the latest `Release` workflow run ID, GitHub release URL, and direct links to the dry-run, skip, and permissions-failure logs stored under `docs/bmad/focused-epics/release-governance/evidence/`. Ensure any missing artifacts (e.g., updated dry-run output) are captured and referenced. (Sources: [Story 1 follow-up tasks](../bmad/focused-epics/release-governance/story-1.md#follow-up-tasks), [Story 1.2 risk profile follow-up tasks](../bmad/focused-epics/release-governance/story-1.2-risk-profile.md#follow-up-tasks))
2. Cross-link `docs/release-automation.md` and `docs/versioning-and-releases.md` so the Conventional Commit → semantic-release matrix, evidence checklist, and retention guidance reference each other explicitly, reducing duplicate lookup steps. (Source: [Story 1.2 test design follow-up tasks](../bmad/focused-epics/release-governance/story-1.2-test-design.md#follow-up-tasks))
3. Execute a fresh semantic-release dry run (`npx semantic-release --dry-run --no-ci`) and trigger the GitHub `Release` workflow on `main`, recording the resulting run ID, outcome summary, tarball decision, and log locations inside Story 1’s change log and the evidence directory. (Sources: [Story 1.2 test design follow-up tasks](../bmad/focused-epics/release-governance/story-1.2-test-design.md#follow-up-tasks), [Release automation evidence checklist](../release-automation.md#evidence-capture-checklist-story-1--12))
4. Reconcile the release-governance epic checklist by marking completed items (compatibility requirements, DoD checklist, validation checklist) and noting any remaining blockers with links to collected evidence or justification. (Sources: [Release-governance epic success criteria](../bmad/focused-epics/release-governance/epic.md#success-criteria), [Release-governance epic validation checklist](../bmad/focused-epics/release-governance/epic.md#validation-checklist))

  - [x] Document any remaining blockers or waivers directly in the epic file or Story 1. (Source: [Release-governance epic validation checklist](../bmad/focused-epics/release-governance/epic.md#validation-checklist))

## Dev Notes

- **Previous Story Insights:** Story 1 established the GitHub-only semantic-release workflow, while Story 1.2 focused on evidence governance and artifact policy; both left follow-ups to attach run IDs, dry-run logs, and cross-document references. (Sources: [Story 1 follow-up tasks](../bmad/focused-epics/release-governance/story-1.md#follow-up-tasks), [Story 1.2 risk profile follow-up tasks](../bmad/focused-epics/release-governance/story-1.2-risk-profile.md#follow-up-tasks))
- **Evidence Requirements:** QA artifacts call for dry-run output, permissions failure logs, and release URLs to live under `docs/bmad/focused-epics/release-governance/evidence/` with links from Story 1 change log. (Sources: [Story 1.2 test scenarios](../bmad/focused-epics/release-governance/story-1.2-test-design.md#test-scenarios), [Release governance evidence directory](../bmad/focused-epics/release-governance/evidence/))
- **Documentation Touchpoints:** The release runbook and versioning guide must reference each other’s matrix, checklist, and retention guidance to prevent context switching. (Sources: [Release automation evidence checklist](../release-automation.md#evidence-capture-checklist-story-1--12), [Versioning workflow overview](../versioning-and-releases.md#-automated-release-workflow))
- **Workflow Commands:** Use `npx semantic-release --dry-run --no-ci` for local validation and trigger `.github/workflows/release.yaml` via GitHub Actions (`gh workflow run release.yaml --ref main`) to produce auditable logs. (Source: [Versioning guide developer tips](../versioning-and-releases.md#developer-tips))
- **Evidence Directory Snapshot:** Current artifacts include `release-run-18019240174.log`, `semantic-release-dry-run-20250925.log`, and permissions failure logs; replace or append with the latest run output. (Source: [Release governance evidence directory](../bmad/focused-epics/release-governance/evidence/))
- **Project Structure Notes:** `.bmad-core/core-config.yaml` references sharded architecture files (`docs/architecture/...`), but those shards are not present; no additional architectural constraints are available. Document this gap if developers request architecture references. (Source: [.bmad-core/core-config.yaml](../../.bmad-core/core-config.yaml))

## Testing

- `REL1.3-T1` — Execute `npx semantic-release --dry-run --no-ci`, confirm output references the GitHub plugin stack, and archive the log in the evidence directory. (Source: [Story 1.2 test scenarios](../bmad/focused-epics/release-governance/story-1.2-test-design.md#test-scenarios))
- `REL1.3-T2` — Trigger the GitHub `Release` workflow on `main`, verify success status, tarball decision, and capture run ID + release URL in Story 1 change log. (Source: [Versioning guide developer tips](../versioning-and-releases.md#developer-tips))
- `REL1.3-T3` — Validate that the release runbook and versioning guide cross-reference each other’s matrix/checklist sections via working anchors. (Source: [Release automation evidence checklist](../release-automation.md#evidence-capture-checklist-story-1--12))
- `REL1.3-T4` — Inspect the release-governance epic checklist to ensure completed items now link to evidence and remaining gaps are documented or waived. (Source: [Release-governance epic validation checklist](../bmad/focused-epics/release-governance/epic.md#validation-checklist))
