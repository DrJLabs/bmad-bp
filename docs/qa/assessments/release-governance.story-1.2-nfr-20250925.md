# NFR Assessment – Story 1.2 (Finalize Release Evidence & Artifact Governance)

Date: 2025-09-25
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)
Scope: security, performance, reliability, maintainability

## Summary

- **Status:** PASS
- **Quality Score:** 100
- **Key Notes:** Runtime baseline captured and artifact policy validated via Release run `18019240174`.

## Findings

### Security – PASS

- Evidence capture instructions preserve release audit trails; no new secrets introduced.
- Manual release run metadata recorded for traceability.

### Performance – PASS

- Release workflow run `18019240174` completed in 44 s; runbook now documents ≤60 s as target runtime.
- Future runs should flag deviations beyond this threshold.

### Reliability – PASS

- Release workflow run `18019240174` verified GitHub release `v1.0.0` retains asset `bmad-drj-1.0.0.tgz`; change log updated accordingly.

### Maintainability – PASS

- Runbook now includes step-by-step checklist and retention guidance, improving future maintainability of the release process.

## Recommended Actions

1. Consider adding automated telemetry to flag missing release artifacts or runtime regression.
