### Summary

| Category        | Status     | Notes                                                                                                                  |
| --------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Performance     | âœ… Pass    | Dry-run logs confirm semantic-release executes within expected time; mainline run pending for full cycle confirmation. |
| Reliability     | âš  Pending | Negative-permission failure captured; need production Actions run evidence to complete verification.                   |
| Observability   | âœ… Pass    | Documentation updated with retention guidance and evidence checklist.                                                  |
| Security        | âœ… Pass    | Workflow permissions hardened (`contents: write`) and restricted-token failure logs recorded.                          |
| Compliance      | âœ… Pass    | SOC2 CC8 alignment covered through runbook instructions and evidence capture tasks.                                    |
| Maintainability | âœ… Pass    | Shared manifest helper added; documentation centralized to reduce duplication.                                         |

### Detailed Findings

1. **Reliability â€“ Mainline Release Evidence Pending**
   - Impact: Medium
   - Detail: Need Actions run ID + release URL after merge to fully demonstrate REL-T2 success on `main`.
   - Recommendation: Record evidence in story change log once the workflow runs on `main`.

2. **Observability â€“ Evidence Checklist Implemented**
   - Impact: Low
   - Detail: Runbook now walks maintainers through dry-run, failure path, and retention logging; no further action required.

3. **Security â€“ Token Scope Validation Captured**
   - Impact: Low
   - Detail: Restricted token run logs confirm workflow fails safely when permissions are downgraded.

### Action Items

1. Capture mainline Actions run ID and release URL post-merge (Owner: Maintainer, Due: 2025-09-29).
2. Attach skip-behavior log for REL-T6 once available (Owner: Maintainer, Due: 2025-09-30).

### NFR Conclusion

Overall Status: **PASS with Follow-up** â€” Non-functional requirements are satisfied with minor post-merge evidence capture remaining.
