# NFR Assessment: Story 1.3 (Close Release Evidence & Governance Checklist)

Date: 2025-09-25
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Summary

- **Security:** PASS — Evidence capture uses repository artifacts only; no secrets required. Release workflow relies solely on `GITHUB_TOKEN` (verified in run 18021773065 logs).
- **Performance:** PASS — Release workflow completed in 37s with semantic-release skipping due to no changes; dry-run executes in ~4s locally. No runtime regressions.
- **Reliability:** PARTIAL — Release workflow executed successfully but produced a skip outcome; future commits still need validation. Recommend rerunning on next code change to confirm artifact upload path.
- **Maintainability:** PASS — Documentation cross-links reduce drift; epic checklist now references evidence, making future audits easier.

## Evidence

- Dry run log: `docs/bmad/focused-epics/release-governance/evidence/semantic-release-dry-run-20250925T213955Z.log`
- Release workflow log: `docs/bmad/focused-epics/release-governance/evidence/release-run-18021773065.log`
- Documentation updates: `docs/release-automation.md`, `docs/versioning-and-releases.md`
- Epic checklist updates: `docs/bmad/focused-epics/release-governance/epic.md`

## Findings

- **R1 (Reliability, Medium):** Release workflow validated a skip path; need follow-up run when new commits trigger a version bump. Track in Story 1 change log.

## Recommendations

1. Schedule another release workflow run after next semantic-release eligible commit to confirm artifact attachments.
2. Consider automating log archiving post-run to avoid manual steps.
