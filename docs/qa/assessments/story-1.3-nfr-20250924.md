# NFR Assessment: 1.3

Date: 2025-09-24
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Summary

- Security: PASS — Reviewer stage and telemetry sync introduce no new secret handling; commands operate on repository artifacts only.
- Performance: PASS — Reviewer dry-run shows 23–25s runtime (well below 180s warning threshold) with cache footprint <5 MB.
- Reliability: PASS — Reviewer dry-run matrix (GitHub Actions run 17993801430) executed default and strict modes with metrics validation.
- Maintainability: PASS — Strict-mode governance thresholds documented and linked in rollout checklist; telemetry script automation remains future work.

## Critical Issues

## Quick Wins

- ✅ Reviewer dry-run job wired into `pr-validation.yaml` (run 17993801430 covers default/strict).
- Add lightweight unit test for `tools/reviewer/telemetry-sync.mjs` covering direct file + directory inputs.
- ✅ Strict-mode threshold doc populated and referenced in rollout tracker.

## Evidence

- Telemetry metrics: `artifacts/reviewer/20250925T010832Z/metrics.json`, `artifacts/reviewer/20250925T010849Z/metrics.json`, `artifacts/reviewer/20250924T231519Z/metrics.json`, `artifacts/reviewer/20250924T231715Z/metrics.json`
- Documentation: `docs/bmad/reviewer/README.md`, `docs/bmad/issues/reviewer-rollout.md`, `docs/bmad/issues/reviewer-telemetry-thresholds.md`

  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: Reviewer commands operate locally; no new secrets or external calls introduced.
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: Latest reviewer runs finish in ≤25s with <5 MB cache usage (targets <180s/<250 MB).
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: Reviewer dry-run matrix (run 17993801430) validated default/strict reviewer execution in GitHub Actions.
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: Strict-mode thresholds documented with cited benchmarks; telemetry sync script untested.
