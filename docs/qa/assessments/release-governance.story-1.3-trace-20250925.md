Date: 2025-09-25
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Coverage Summary

- Total Acceptance Criteria: 4
- Fully Covered: 3
- Partially Covered: 1 (AC3 – release run executed but skipped because no new commits)
- Not Covered: 0

## Requirement Mappings

### AC1 – Story 1 change log updated with latest Release workflow evidence

- Evidence: Story 1 change log "Evidence++" row (2025-09-25) referencing run 18021773065 and new dry-run log.
- Artifacts: `docs/bmad/focused-epics/release-governance/evidence/semantic-release-dry-run-20250925T213955Z.log`, `docs/bmad/focused-epics/release-governance/evidence/release-run-18021773065.log`.
- Coverage: **Full** – log references and artifacts present, cross-checked against run output.

### AC2 – Cross-link release documentation

- Evidence: `docs/release-automation.md` evidence checklist links to versioning doc; `docs/versioning-and-releases.md` references release automation section and timestamp requirement.
- Validation: Manual anchor verification logged in Story 1 change log (2025-09-25T21:45Z).
- Coverage: **Full**.

### AC3 – Fresh dry run and Release workflow triggered, results recorded

- Evidence: Dry run log saved (see AC1); Release workflow run 18021773065 executed (semantic-release skipped – no new commits) with log archived.
- Gap: No new release artifacts produced because repo has no commits since last release; decision noted in change log.
- Coverage: **Partial** – run executed but outcome was "skip"; acceptable for audit but follow-up needed when new release-worthy commits land.

### AC4 – Epic checklist reconciled with evidence links / blockers

- Evidence: `docs/bmad/focused-epics/release-governance/epic.md` updated with checked items, references to Story 1 change log and evidence logs.
- Coverage: **Full**.

## Follow-Ups

- When a new release-worthy commit merges, rerun `release.yaml` to produce release artifacts and update Story 1 change log accordingly.
