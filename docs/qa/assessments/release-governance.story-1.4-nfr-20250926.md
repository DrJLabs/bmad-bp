# NFR Assessment: Story 1.4 (Automate Release Evidence Capture & Post-Change Validation)

Date: 2025-09-26
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)
Quality Score: 100

## Summary

- **Security:** PASS — CLI command avoids exposing secrets, relies on GitHub CLI auth and stores log output in repo-controlled directories.
- **Performance:** PASS — Script is lightweight; helper functions perform minimal filesystem and subprocess work.
- **Reliability:** PASS — Automation executed against release run 18024216996, with evidence archived under the timestamped directory.
- **Maintainability:** PASS — Helper logic covered by unit tests; documentation updated to guide usage.

## Findings

- Captured `gh auth status` output (run 18024216996) for audit trail; no secrets stored.
- Live release run verified automation handles absence of artifacts gracefully while recording metadata/logs.

## Recommendations

1. Optional: add mocked CLI integration tests to cover additional failure modes without GH access.
2. Include automated link checking for release documentation anchors in future maintenance work.

## Gate Snippet

  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Automation defers to gh CLI auth; no secrets written to disk.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Helper functions and CLI invocation are lightweight (<1s baseline).'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Release run 18024216996 executed on main; automation captured metadata/logs successfully.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Unit tests cover path helpers; documentation instructs maintainers.'
