# NFR Assessment: Story 1.4 (Automate Release Evidence Capture & Post-Change Validation)

Date: 2025-09-26
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)
Quality Score: 90

## Summary

- **Security:** PASS — CLI command avoids exposing secrets, relies on GitHub CLI auth and stores log output in repo-controlled directories.
- **Performance:** PASS — Script is lightweight; helper functions perform minimal filesystem and subprocess work.
- **Reliability:** CONCERNS — Integration path (AC3) not yet executed; automation still awaiting validation against a live release run.
- **Maintainability:** PASS — Helper logic covered by unit tests; documentation updated to guide usage.

## Findings

- Captures `gh auth status` output; confirm it does not include sensitive tokens before pushing to Story 1 change log.
- Need follow-up run on `main` to prove script handles real artifacts and skipped releases gracefully.

## Recommendations

1. Execute `npm run release:evidence -- --run-id <main-run>` after the next release-worthy commit and attach outputs to Story 1 change log.
2. Consider adding a mocked CLI integration test to exercise command failure paths without relying on live credentials.

## Gate Snippet

  _assessed:
    - security
    - performance

    - maintainability
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Automation defers to gh CLI auth; no secrets written to disk.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Helper functions and CLI invocation are lightweight (<1s baseline).'
  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: 'Awaiting real release run evidence; only unit helpers exercised so far.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Unit tests cover path helpers; documentation instructs maintainers.'
```
