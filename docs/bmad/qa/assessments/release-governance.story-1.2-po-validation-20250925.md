# PO Validation – Story 1.2: Finalize Release Evidence & Artifact Governance

Date: 2025-09-25
Reviewer: Sarah (Product Owner)

## Template Compliance Issues

- None. Story sections match `story-template-v2`, all placeholders resolved, and required agent sections remain intact for downstream updates.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix – Story Blocked)

- None. Story is complete and evidence-backed.

## Should-Fix Issues

- None – prior reminders addressed through Dev Notes/tasks updates.

## Nice-to-Have Improvements

- Consider adding a note in the runbook pointing to automated monitoring ideas if telemetry tooling becomes available.

## Anti-Hallucination Findings

- All technical statements reference existing documentation (`docs/release-automation.md`, `docs/versioning-and-releases.md`, Story 1 artifacts). No unsupported libraries or patterns introduced.
- Dev Notes explicitly acknowledge the missing `docs/architecture/` shards from `.bmad-core/core-config.yaml`, preventing wasted effort.

## Final Assessment

- **GO** – Story approved for release.
- **Implementation Readiness Score:** 10/10
- **Confidence Level:** High – Documentation, evidence, and QA gate now satisfied.

## Follow-Up Actions

- None required.
