## Validation Summary

- Evidence logs (dry-run + release run 18021773065) recorded in Story 1 change log with references to archived files.
- Release automation and versioning docs now cross-reference each other; verification timestamp captured.
- Epic checklist updated with supporting evidence links and remaining follow-up (rerun release after next eligible commit).
- QA artifacts (trace, NFR, review, gate) attached; outstanding risk noted as "monitor" only.
