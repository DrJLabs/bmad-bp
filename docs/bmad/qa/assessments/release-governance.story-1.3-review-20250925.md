# QA Review: Story 1.3 (Close Release Evidence & Governance Checklist)

Date: 2025-09-25
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)
Status: PASS_WITH_NOTE

## Scope Reviewed

- Story file `docs/stories/1.3.release-evidence-audit-closure.md`
- Evidence directory updates (`semantic-release-dry-run-20250925T213955Z.log`, `release-run-18021773065.log`)
- Release documentation cross-links (`docs/release-automation.md`, `docs/versioning-and-releases.md`)
- Release-governance epic checklist (`docs/bmad/focused-epics/release-governance/epic.md`)

## Findings

1. **Evidence Trail** — Dry-run log captured and indexed; Release workflow run 18021773065 executed and logged (skip outcome). Story 1 change log references both artifacts.
2. **Documentation Alignment** — Reciprocal anchors between release automation and versioning docs verified, timestamp recorded in Story 1 change log.
3. **Epic Checklist** — Success criteria marked complete with references; validation checklist notes remaining dependency on future release run.

### Notes / Risks

- Release workflow skip is expected (no new commits). Flag remains to rerun after next semantic-release eligible change.
- Consider automating log downloads to reduce manual effort (tracked in Follow-Up Tasks).

## Recommendation

- Approve with note: story meets requirements for evidence closure. QA recommends tracking the next release run to verify artifact attachments when there are new commits.
