# Story 1: Align Release Workflow with BMAD GitHub-Only Pattern

## Status

- Ready for Review

## Story

**As the** release maintainer for chat-mcp-farm,
**I want** the release automation to match BMADâ€™s GitHub-only semantic-release flow,
**so that** every push to `main` tags a release, updates the changelog, and avoids failing npm publish steps.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Add or update a GitHub Actions release workflow that runs semantic-release with GitHub plugins only (no npm publish) and succeeds on `main`.
2. Configure semantic-release (`.releaserc` or equivalent) to skip npm publishing, pin the GitHub-only plugin set (`@semantic-release/release-notes-generator`, `@semantic-release/changelog`, `@semantic-release/github`), and ensure the changelog and GitHub release artifacts are emitted.
3. Update `.bmad-core/install-manifest.yaml` to include the new reviewer tooling and bump the BMAD version reference.
4. Document the release process (runbook entry under `docs/`) including how to trigger releases, where GitHub release notes/assets live, and how to capture evidence.
5. Configure the release workflow with explicit `permissions` (minimum `contents: write`) and document how to verify the job uses the repository `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
6. Demonstrate a successful dry-run (`semantic-release --dry-run`) and a passing CI run on a PR branch with artifacts recorded in the story change log.
7. Provide rollback guidance for mis-tagged releases (e.g., reverting commits/tags) in the runbook so maintainers can recover from workflow failures.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Create `.github/workflows/release.yaml` mirroring BMADâ€™s GitHub-only workflow (trigger on `main`) with explicit `permissions` and `environment` hardening.
- [x] Add `.releaserc.json` (or update existing config) to disable npm publish (`"npmPublish": false`), pin the plugin versions, and configure changelog + GitHub assets.
- [x] Run `semantic-release --dry-run` locally to verify configuration before committing CI changes and attach logs to the story.
- [x] Update `.bmad-core/install-manifest.yaml` to version 4.43.2 (or later) and list new files (reviewer docs, tooling).
- [x] Update `docs/release-automation.md` with GitHub-only guidance, release asset locations, rollback steps, and remove npm references.
- [x] Open PR, ensure PR validation passes (including reviewer jobs), then merge and confirm the release workflow succeeds on `main`; capture the Actions run ID and release URL in the story change log.
- [x] Verify the release workflow runs with the repository `GITHUB_TOKEN` by inspecting Actions permissions output and logging the evidence in the change log (AC5, AC6).

## Dev Notes

- Mirror `.github/workflows/release.yaml` after BMADâ€™s template, including `permissions: contents: write` and the semantic-release job that runs on pushes to `main` (AC1, AC5).
- Configure `.releaserc.json` with `"npmPublish": false` and pin `@semantic-release/release-notes-generator`, `@semantic-release/changelog`, and `@semantic-release/github`; ensure the changelog path matches repo expectations (AC2).
- Update `.bmad-core/install-manifest.yaml` entries for the workflow, semantic-release config, and reviewer tooling; rerun `npm run bmad:validate` to confirm manifest integrity (AC3).
- Revise `docs/release-automation.md` to document GitHub-only releases, evidence capture locations, rollback steps, and the negative-permission test (AC4, AC7).
- Store evidence artifacts (`semantic-release` dry-run log, restricted-permission failure, Actions run IDs) under `docs/bmad/focused-epics/release-governance/` and reference them in the change log (AC6).

## Testing

- **REL-T1 (Dry run / AC1, AC2, AC6):** Run `npx semantic-release --dry-run --ci false` on the feature branch and attach the console output to the change log.
- **REL-T2 (Mainline release / AC1â€“AC4, AC6):** After merging, confirm the `release` workflow succeeds on `main`, produces a GitHub release with notes, and record the run ID plus release URL in the change log.
- **REL-T3 (Negative permissions / AC5):** Execute a branch run with `permissions: contents: read` to validate the expected failure; store the log excerpt alongside REL-T1 artifacts.
- **REL-T4 (Manifest validation / AC3):** Run `npm run bmad:validate` after manifest updates and retain the command output.
- **REL-T5 (Documentation review / AC4, AC7):** Peer review `docs/release-automation.md` to confirm rollback and evidence guidance, then log reviewer sign-off.
- **REL-T6 (Skip behavior / AC2):** Push or emulate a `chore:` commit and capture the semantic-release skip message for regression coverage.

## QA Notes

- Validate that the release workflow run on `main` completes successfully and creates a GitHub release draft/tag.
- Ensure documentation updates clearly specify the GitHub release process.
- Link all evidence artifacts (dry-run logs, restricted-permission failure, run IDs, release URL) in the change log table for auditability.

### Tooling Guidance

- **FOSS-first Recommendation:** Use the upstream `semantic-release` CLI with the default GitHub plugins and `semantic-release --dry-run` for validation.
- **Paid Option (if required):** None â€” no paid services needed if GitHub-hosted runners meet retention requirements.
- **Automation / Scripts:** `npx semantic-release --dry-run --ci false` (for PR validation) and a one-off workflow job that toggles `permissions: contents: read` to exercise the negative path.

### Risk & Compliance Notes

- **Residual Risks:** Organization-level token hardening could still downgrade permissions, producing 403 errors in mainline runs; track this in release runbook.
- **Compliance / Control Mapping:** Aligns with SOC2 CC8.1 change management evidence and BMAD Release Governance requirements.
- **Monitoring / Observability:** Capture workflow run URLs and release artifact links in the story change log; alert on failed release jobs in GitHub Actions.
- **Rollback / Contingency:** Document tag rollback via `gh release delete <tag>` and `git push --delete origin <tag>` plus manifest revert procedure.
