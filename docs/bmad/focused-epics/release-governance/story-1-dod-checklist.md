- [N/A] Coverage thresholds not applicable (no code changes subject to coverage).

## 4. Functionality & Verification

- [x] Manual verification performed via semantic-release dry run and permissions failure simulation.
- [x] Edge cases considered (restricted token permissions path captured).

## 5. Story Administration

- [x] All tasks marked complete in story file with notes on remaining evidence capture post-merge.
- [x] Decisions and references documented in Dev Agent Record and change log.
- [x] Dev Agent Record updated with model, logs, completion notes, and file list; change log reflects work.

## 6. Dependencies, Build & Configuration

- [x] Project builds/validations run successfully (`npm run validate`).

## Final Confirmation

- Summary: Converted release pipeline to GitHub-only semantic-release pattern, updated configuration/docs, captured dry-run & restricted-token evidence, and stored validation logs under release governance evidence.
- Outstanding actions: Capture actual Actions run ID and release URL after PR merge; upload release artifacts from mainline run.
- Technical debt/follow-up: None introduced; monitor follow-up tasks in story file.
- Challenges: Required adjusting local `bmad:validate` script to use repository CLI; documented change.
- [x] I, the Developer Agent, confirm that all applicable items above have been addressed and the story is ready for review.
