# Validate Plan with Research Task (Autonomous)

## Purpose

Automatically review a project artifact, conduct targeted research on its core concepts, apply updates to align the plan with modern best practices, and then report a summary of all changes made to the primary artifact and its companions. The scope and deliverables must respect the researcher's active mode (`solo`, `small-team`, or `enterprise`).

## Inputs

- `artifact_path`: File path to the primary project artifact to be validated (e.g., `docs/stories/1.1.setup-initial-project.md`).
- `active_mode`: Optional override (`solo`|`small-team`|`enterprise`). Default is `solo` when omitted.

## Mode Controls

Before modification, note the current mode and adjust depth accordingly:

- **Solo mode (default):**
  - Prioritize high-impact, low-effort fixes and quick automation wins.
  - Keep documentation lean: update the research log and list the top three follow-up actions.
  - Favor free/open-source tooling; only suggest paid services with rationale and migration notes.
- **Small-team mode:**
  - Capture decisions that teammates need for code review, CI/CD, and ops handoffs.
  - Produce a change summary with owners/reviewers and flag dependencies requiring alignment.
  - Recommend FOSS-first solutions that integrate cleanly with lightweight SaaS if unavoidable.
- **Enterprise mode:**
  - Perform exhaustive validation covering security, compliance, reliability, and governance.
  - Create an audit-ready dossier: include risk register entries, control mappings, and rollback plans.
  - Document data handling, monitoring, and separation-of-duties requirements; note cost/risk trade-offs when paid tooling is involved.

## Prerequisites

- Load the `researcher-checklist.md` and review items relevant to the active mode.
- Ensure the `research-validation-log.md` template is available for updating artifacts.

## Process (Must be followed sequentially)

### 1. Acknowledge and Load Artifact

- Announce task start, active mode, and the artifact being reviewed.
- Load the content of the file specified in `artifact_path`.

### 2. Contextual Analysis of Artifact

- Determine the type of artifact being reviewed (e.g., Story, Test Design, Architecture Doc).
- Tailor emphasis based on artifact type:
  - **Story:** Focus on implementation details, security, performance, and release readiness.
  - **Test Design:** Emphasize testing methodologies, frameworks, resilience, and observability coverage.
  - **Architecture/Plan:** Assess alignment with reference architectures, scalability, and compliance.

### 3. Identify Key Concepts for Research

- Parse the artifact to identify core technical concepts, patterns, dependencies, or strategies that require validation.
- Bucket concepts by risk level (critical, moderate, informational) and note required source depth per mode.

### 4. Generate & Execute Research

- For each concept, use the `create-deep-research-prompt.md` task tailored to the active mode to formulate precise research questions.
- Execute research and synthesize findings into concise best-practice summaries, including alternatives and common pitfalls.
- Cross-check medium/high-risk findings with at least two credible sources; record citations with access dates.
- Prefer open documentation, standards bodies, and widely adopted FOSS tooling when recommending solutions.

### 5. Formulate Changes and Update Artifacts

- Compare research findings with the plan outlined in the primary artifact.
- Formulate a specific list of changes needed to align the plan with best practices and mode requirements.
- Create a new working branch (for example, `chore/validate-{{artifact_id}}-{{date}}`), apply updates there, and raise a PR for review instead of committing directly to the default branch.
- Sanitize and allowlist `artifact_path` inputs to repository-internal documents only (reject absolute paths and `..` segments).
- **Identify any companion documents** (e.g., risk profiles, test designs with matching story ID) and propose cascading changes within the same PR.
- For each modified artifact:
  - Append or update the `## ðŸ”¬ Research & Validation Log` section using the `research-validation-log.md` template.
  - Note the active mode, decision rationale, confidence level, and residual risks.
  - Document tooling recommendations with FOSS-first alternatives.

## Security & Safety Guardrails

- Treat `artifact_path` as untrusted input: normalize, resolve, and validate against an allowlist such as `docs/**` and `bmad-core/**` (no absolute paths, URLs, or `..` segments).
- Provide a dry-run mode that emits a patch/diff without writing files when the user requests it.
- Keep edits bounded and idempotentâ€”flag when proposed changes exceed expected size/line thresholds.
- Record all changes in the research validation log while ensuring secrets and PII are never persisted.

### 6. Generate Final Summary Report

- After all files have been modified and saved, output a final, standalone summary report in the following format:

---

**Research & Validation Summary**

- **Primary Artifact Validated:** `{{artifact_path}}`
- **Active Mode:** `{{active_mode}}`
- **Status:** Complete. Artifacts have been updated automatically.

**Modified Files:**

- `{{list_of_all_modified_files}}`

**Summary of Changes:**

- **Modernization:** {{mode-aware modernization summary with citations}}
- **Security & Compliance:** {{security/compliance findings; include control mappings for enterprise mode}}
- **Testing & Quality:** {{test coverage changes, tooling updates}}
- **Operational Follow-ups:** {{owners, next steps, deadlines}}

_For a detailed breakdown of every change, see the "Research & Validation Log" section in each modified artifact. Refer to the researcher checklist to confirm that all items for `{{active_mode}}` are satisfied._

---

## Completion Criteria

- All relevant artifacts updated with mode-appropriate research logs and citations.
- Summary report delivered with clear next steps and ownership.
- Researcher checklist items for the active mode verified and noted in the log.

# Researcher Checklist

Use this checklist to confirm research and validation work meets the baseline hygiene requirements for the active mode. When executing tasks, reference the sections that match the current mode (`solo`, `small-team`, `enterprise`).

## Global Hygiene

- [ ] Document the active mode and rationale in the research log.
- [ ] Cite all key findings with source, publisher, publish/version date, and access date.
- [ ] Use durable links: prefer permalinks to specific versions/tags and capture an archived copy (e.g., web.archive) for each URL.
- [ ] Record license/usage terms for tools and sources; flag incompatible or high-risk licenses and suggest compliant alternatives.
- [ ] Cross-check medium/high-risk claims with at least two credible references.
- [ ] Flag deprecated, end-of-life, or insecure patterns and propose modern alternatives.
- [ ] Note residual risks, confidence levels, and required follow-up owners.
- [ ] Prefer FOSS tooling; justify any paid solution with cost, benefit, and migration plan.
- [ ] Store research artifacts using the `research-validation-log.md` template.

## Solo Mode Focus

- [ ] Highlight top three actions that unlock immediate progress for a single developer.
- [ ] Provide automation scripts or CLI snippets where possible.
- [ ] Ensure recommendations account for budget/time constraints typical of indie projects.
- [ ] Include a quick rollback or mitigation approach for each high-risk change.

## Small-Team Focus

- [ ] Assign owners/reviewers for each major recommendation (RACI-style).
- [ ] Map recommendations to CI/CD, code review, and documentation touchpoints.
- [ ] Capture dependency upgrades with testing/automation status.
- [ ] Identify collaboration or knowledge-sharing needs (demos, playbooks, docs).

## Enterprise Focus

- [ ] Map findings to relevant compliance or security controls (e.g., SOC2, ISO 27001, OWASP ASVS) and reference specific control IDs.
- [ ] Provide threat model updates and monitoring/logging guidance.
- [ ] Document data classification, retention, and access control impacts.
- [ ] Note data residency/jurisdictional constraints and third-party/vendor risk (DPAs, sub-processors, attestations).
- [ ] Record sign-off checkpoints, required stakeholders, and audit evidence locations.
- [ ] Provide rollback, incident response, and change management considerations.

# BMADâ„¢ Knowledge Base

## Overview

BMAD-METHODâ„¢ (Breakthrough Method of Agile AI-driven Development) is a framework that combines AI agents with Agile development methodologies. The v4 system introduces a modular architecture with improved dependency management, bundle optimization, and support for both web and IDE environments.

### Key Features

- **Modular Agent System**: Specialized AI agents for each Agile role
- **Build System**: Automated dependency resolution and optimization
- **Dual Environment Support**: Optimized for both web UIs and IDEs
- **Reusable Resources**: Portable templates, tasks, and checklists
- **Slash Command Integration**: Quick agent switching and control

### When to Use BMad

- **New Projects (Greenfield)**: Complete end-to-end development
- **Existing Projects (Brownfield)**: Feature additions and enhancements
- **Team Collaboration**: Multiple roles working together
- **Quality Assurance**: Structured testing and validation
- **Documentation**: Professional PRDs, architecture docs, user stories

## How BMad Works

### The Core Method

BMad transforms you into a "Vibe CEO" - directing a team of specialized AI agents through structured workflows. Here's how:

1. **You Direct, AI Executes**: You provide vision and decisions; agents handle implementation details
2. **Specialized Agents**: Each agent masters one role (PM, Developer, Architect, etc.)
3. **Structured Workflows**: Proven patterns guide you from idea to deployed code
4. **Clean Handoffs**: Fresh context windows ensure agents stay focused and effective

### The Two-Phase Approach

#### Phase 1: Planning (Web UI - Cost Effective)

- Use large context windows (Gemini's 1M tokens)
- Generate comprehensive documents (PRD, Architecture)
- Leverage multiple agents for brainstorming
- Create once, use throughout development

#### Phase 2: Development (IDE - Implementation)

- Shard documents into manageable pieces
- Execute focused SM â†’ Dev cycles
- One story at a time, sequential progress
- Real-time file operations and testing

### The Development Loop

```text
1. SM Agent (New Chat) â†’ Creates next story from sharded docs
2. You â†’ Review and approve story
3. Dev Agent (New Chat) â†’ Implements approved story
4. QA Agent (New Chat) â†’ Reviews and refactors code
5. You â†’ Verify completion
6. Repeat until epic complete
```

### Why This Works

- **Context Optimization**: Clean chats = better AI performance
- **Role Clarity**: Agents don't context-switch = higher quality
- **Incremental Progress**: Small stories = manageable complexity
- **Human Oversight**: You validate each step = quality control
- **Document-Driven**: Specs guide everything = consistency

## Getting Started

### Quick Start Options

#### Option 1: Web UI

**Best for**: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini users who want to start immediately

1. Navigate to `dist/teams/`
2. Copy `team-fullstack.txt` content
3. Create new Gemini Gem or CustomGPT
4. Upload file with instructions: "Your critical operating instructions are attached, do not break character as directed"
5. Type `/help` to see available commands

#### Option 2: IDE Integration

**Best for**: Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, Trae, Cline, Roo Code, Github Copilot users

```bash
# Interactive installation (recommended)
npx -p bmad-drj bmad-method install
```

**Installation Steps**:

- Choose "Complete installation"
- Select your IDE from supported options:
  - **Cursor**: Native AI integration
  - **Claude Code**: Anthropic's official IDE
  - **Windsurf**: Built-in AI capabilities
  - **Trae**: Built-in AI capabilities
  - **Cline**: VS Code extension with AI features
  - **Roo Code**: Web-based IDE with agent support
  - **GitHub Copilot**: VS Code extension with AI peer programming assistant
  - **Auggie CLI (Augment Code)**: AI-powered development environment

**Note for VS Code Users**: BMAD-METHODâ„¢ assumes when you mention "VS Code" that you're using it with an AI-powered extension like GitHub Copilot, Cline, or Roo. Standard VS Code without AI capabilities cannot run BMad agents. The installer includes built-in support for Cline and Roo.

**Verify Installation**:

- `.bmad-core/` folder created with all agents
- IDE-specific integration files created
- All agent commands/rules/modes available

**Remember**: At its core, BMAD-METHODâ„¢ is about mastering and harnessing prompt engineering. Any IDE with AI agent support can use BMad - the framework provides the structured prompts and workflows that make AI development effective

### Environment Selection Guide

**Use Web UI for**:

- Initial planning and documentation (PRD, architecture)
- Cost-effective document creation (especially with Gemini)
- Brainstorming and analysis phases
- Multi-agent consultation and planning

**Use IDE for**:

- Active development and coding
- File operations and project integration
- Document sharding and story management
- Implementation workflow (SM/Dev cycles)

**Cost-Saving Tip**: Create large documents (PRDs, architecture) in web UI, then copy to `docs/prd.md` and `docs/architecture.md` in your project before switching to IDE for development.

### IDE-Only Workflow Considerations

**Can you do everything in IDE?** Yes, but understand the tradeoffs:

**Pros of IDE-Only**:

- Single environment workflow
- Direct file operations from start
- No copy/paste between environments
- Immediate project integration

**Cons of IDE-Only**:

- Higher token costs for large document creation
- Smaller context windows (varies by IDE/model)
- May hit limits during planning phases
- Less cost-effective for brainstorming

**Using Web Agents in IDE**:

- **NOT RECOMMENDED**: Web agents (PM, Architect) have rich dependencies designed for large contexts
- **Why it matters**: Dev agents are kept lean to maximize coding context
- **The principle**: "Dev agents code, planning agents plan" - mixing breaks this optimization

**About bmad-master and bmad-orchestrator**:

- **bmad-master**: CAN do any task without switching agents, BUT...
- **Still use specialized agents for planning**: PM, Architect, and UX Expert have tuned personas that produce better results
- **Why specialization matters**: Each agent's personality and focus creates higher quality outputs
- **If using bmad-master/orchestrator**: Fine for planning phases, but...

**CRITICAL RULE for Development**:

- **ALWAYS use SM agent for story creation** - Never use bmad-master or bmad-orchestrator
- **ALWAYS use Dev agent for implementation** - Never use bmad-master or bmad-orchestrator
- **Why this matters**: SM and Dev agents are specifically optimized for the development workflow
- **No exceptions**: Even if using bmad-master for everything else, switch to SM â†’ Dev for implementation

**Best Practice for IDE-Only**:

1. Use PM/Architect/UX agents for planning (better than bmad-master)
2. Create documents directly in project
3. Shard immediately after creation
4. **MUST switch to SM agent** for story creation
5. **MUST switch to Dev agent** for implementation
6. Keep planning and coding in separate chat sessions

## Core Configuration (core-config.yaml)

**New in V4**: The `.bmad-core/core-config.yaml` file is a critical innovation that enables BMad to work seamlessly with any project structure, providing maximum flexibility and backwards compatibility.

### What is core-config.yaml?

This configuration file acts as a map for BMad agents, telling them exactly where to find your project documents and how they're structured. It enables:

- **Version Flexibility**: Work with V3, V4, or custom document structures
- **Custom Locations**: Define where your documents and shards live
- **Developer Context**: Specify which files the dev agent should always load
- **Debug Support**: Built-in logging for troubleshooting

### Key Configuration Areas

#### PRD Configuration

- **prdVersion**: Tells agents if PRD follows v3 or v4 conventions
- **prdSharded**: Whether epics are embedded (false) or in separate files (true)
- **prdShardedLocation**: Where to find sharded epic files
- **epicFilePattern**: Pattern for epic filenames (e.g., `epic-{n}*.md`)

#### Architecture Configuration

- **architectureVersion**: v3 (monolithic) or v4 (sharded)
- **architectureSharded**: Whether architecture is split into components
- **architectureShardedLocation**: Where sharded architecture files live

#### Developer Files

- **devLoadAlwaysFiles**: List of files the dev agent loads for every task
- **devDebugLog**: Where dev agent logs repeated failures
- **agentCoreDump**: Export location for chat conversations

### Why It Matters

1. **No Forced Migrations**: Keep your existing document structure
2. **Gradual Adoption**: Start with V3 and migrate to V4 at your pace
3. **Custom Workflows**: Configure BMad to match your team's process
4. **Intelligent Agents**: Agents automatically adapt to your configuration

### Common Configurations

**Legacy V3 Project**:

```yaml
prdVersion: v3
prdSharded: false
architectureVersion: v3
architectureSharded: false
```

**V4 Optimized Project**:

```yaml
prdVersion: v4
prdSharded: true
prdShardedLocation: docs/prd
architectureVersion: v4
architectureSharded: true
architectureShardedLocation: docs/architecture
```

## Core Philosophy

### Vibe CEO'ing

You are the "Vibe CEO" - thinking like a CEO with unlimited resources and a singular vision. Your AI agents are your high-powered team, and your role is to:

- **Direct**: Provide clear instructions and objectives
- **Refine**: Iterate on outputs to achieve quality
- **Oversee**: Maintain strategic alignment across all agents

### Core Principles

1. **MAXIMIZE_AI_LEVERAGE**: Push the AI to deliver more. Challenge outputs and iterate.
2. **QUALITY_CONTROL**: You are the ultimate arbiter of quality. Review all outputs.
3. **STRATEGIC_OVERSIGHT**: Maintain the high-level vision and ensure alignment.
4. **ITERATIVE_REFINEMENT**: Expect to revisit steps. This is not a linear process.
5. **CLEAR_INSTRUCTIONS**: Precise requests lead to better outputs.
6. **DOCUMENTATION_IS_KEY**: Good inputs (briefs, PRDs) lead to good outputs.
7. **START_SMALL_SCALE_FAST**: Test concepts, then expand.
8. **EMBRACE_THE_CHAOS**: Adapt and overcome challenges.

### Key Workflow Principles

1. **Agent Specialization**: Each agent has specific expertise and responsibilities
2. **Clean Handoffs**: Always start fresh when switching between agents
3. **Status Tracking**: Maintain story statuses (Draft â†’ Approved â†’ InProgress â†’ Done)
4. **Iterative Development**: Complete one story before starting the next
5. **Documentation First**: Always start with solid PRD and architecture

## Core Architecture

### System Overview

The BMAD-METHODâ„¢ is built around a modular architecture centered on the `bmad-core` directory, which serves as the brain of the entire system. This design enables the framework to operate effectively in both IDE environments (like Cursor, VS Code) and web-based AI interfaces (like ChatGPT, Gemini).

### Key Architectural Components

#### 1. Agents (`bmad-core/agents/`)

- **Purpose**: Each markdown file defines a specialized AI agent for a specific Agile role (PM, Dev, Architect, etc.)
- **Structure**: Contains YAML headers specifying the agent's persona, capabilities, and dependencies
- **Dependencies**: Lists of tasks, templates, checklists, and data files the agent can use
- **Startup Instructions**: Can load project-specific documentation for immediate context

#### 2. Agent Teams (`bmad-core/agent-teams/`)

- **Purpose**: Define collections of agents bundled together for specific purposes
- **Examples**: `team-all.yaml` (comprehensive bundle), `team-fullstack.yaml` (full-stack development)
- **Usage**: Creates pre-packaged contexts for web UI environments

#### 3. Workflows (`bmad-core/workflows/`)

- **Purpose**: YAML files defining prescribed sequences of steps for specific project types
- **Types**: Greenfield (new projects) and Brownfield (existing projects) for UI, service, and fullstack development
- **Structure**: Defines agent interactions, artifacts created, and transition conditions

#### 4. Reusable Resources

- **Templates** (`bmad-core/templates/`): Markdown templates for PRDs, architecture specs, user stories
- **Tasks** (`bmad-core/tasks/`): Instructions for specific repeatable actions like "shard-doc" or "create-next-story"
- **Checklists** (`bmad-core/checklists/`): Quality assurance checklists for validation and review
- **Data** (`bmad-core/data/`): Core knowledge base and technical preferences

### Dual Environment Architecture

#### IDE Environment

- Users interact directly with agent markdown files
- Agents can access all dependencies dynamically
- Supports real-time file operations and project integration
- Optimized for development workflow execution

#### Web UI Environment

- Uses pre-built bundles from `dist/teams` for stand alone 1 upload files for all agents and their assets with an orchestrating agent
- Single text files containing all agent dependencies are in `dist/agents/` - these are unnecessary unless you want to create a web agent that is only a single agent and not a team
- Created by the web-builder tool for upload to web interfaces
- Provides complete context in one package

### Template Processing System

BMad employs a sophisticated template system with three key components:

1. **Template Format** (`utils/bmad-doc-template.md`): Defines markup language for variable substitution and AI processing directives from yaml templates
2. **Document Creation** (`tasks/create-doc.md`): Orchestrates template selection and user interaction to transform yaml spec to final markdown output
3. **Advanced Elicitation** (`tasks/advanced-elicitation.md`): Provides interactive refinement through structured brainstorming

### Technical Preferences Integration

The `technical-preferences.md` file serves as a persistent technical profile that:

- Ensures consistency across all agents and projects
- Eliminates repetitive technology specification
- Provides personalized recommendations aligned with user preferences
- Evolves over time with lessons learned

### Build and Delivery Process

The `web-builder.js` tool creates web-ready bundles by:

1. Reading agent or team definition files
2. Recursively resolving all dependencies
3. Concatenating content into single text files with clear separators
4. Outputting ready-to-upload bundles for web AI interfaces

This architecture enables seamless operation across environments while maintaining the rich, interconnected agent ecosystem that makes BMad powerful.

## Complete Development Workflow

### Planning Phase (Web UI Recommended - Especially Gemini!)

**Ideal for cost efficiency with Gemini's massive context:**

**For Brownfield Projects - Start Here!**:

1. **Upload entire project to Gemini Web** (GitHub URL, files, or zip)
2. **Document existing system**: `/analyst` â†’ `*document-project`
3. **Creates comprehensive docs** from entire codebase analysis

**For All Projects**:

1. **Optional Analysis**: `/analyst` - Market research, competitive analysis
2. **Project Brief**: Create foundation document (Analyst or user)
3. **PRD Creation**: `/pm create-doc prd` - Comprehensive product requirements
4. **Architecture Design**: `/architect create-doc architecture` - Technical foundation
5. **Validation & Alignment**: `/po` run master checklist to ensure document consistency
6. **Document Preparation**: Copy final documents to project as `docs/prd.md` and `docs/architecture.md`

#### Example Planning Prompts

**For PRD Creation**:

```text
"I want to build a [type] application that [core purpose].
Help me brainstorm features and create a comprehensive PRD."
```

**For Architecture Design**:

```text
"Based on this PRD, design a scalable technical architecture
that can handle [specific requirements]."
```

### Critical Transition: Web UI to IDE

**Once planning is complete, you MUST switch to IDE for development:**

- **Why**: Development workflow requires file operations, real-time project integration, and document sharding
- **Cost Benefit**: Web UI is more cost-effective for large document creation; IDE is optimized for development tasks
- **Required Files**: Ensure `docs/prd.md` and `docs/architecture.md` exist in your project

### IDE Development Workflow

**Prerequisites**: Planning documents must exist in `docs/` folder

1. **Document Sharding** (CRITICAL STEP):
   - Documents created by PM/Architect (in Web or IDE) MUST be sharded for development
   - Two methods to shard:
     a) **Manual**: Drag `shard-doc` task + document file into chat
     b) **Agent**: Ask `@bmad-master` or `@po` to shard documents
   - Shards `docs/prd.md` â†’ `docs/prd/` folder
   - Shards `docs/architecture.md` â†’ `docs/architecture/` folder
   - **WARNING**: Do NOT shard in Web UI - copying many small files is painful!

2. **Verify Sharded Content**:
   - At least one `epic-n.md` file in `docs/prd/` with stories in development order
   - Source tree document and coding standards for dev agent reference
   - Sharded docs for SM agent story creation

Resulting Folder Structure:

- `docs/prd/` - Broken down PRD sections
- `docs/architecture/` - Broken down architecture sections
- `docs/stories/` - Generated user stories

1. **Development Cycle** (Sequential, one story at a time):

   **CRITICAL CONTEXT MANAGEMENT**:
   - **Context windows matter!** Always use fresh, clean context windows
   - **Model selection matters!** Use most powerful thinking model for SM story creation
   - **ALWAYS start new chat between SM, Dev, and QA work**

   **Step 1 - Story Creation**:
   - **NEW CLEAN CHAT** â†’ Select powerful model â†’ `@sm` â†’ `*create`
   - SM executes create-next-story task
   - Review generated story in `docs/stories/`
   - Update status from "Draft" to "Approved"

   **Step 2 - Story Implementation**:
   - **NEW CLEAN CHAT** â†’ `@dev`
   - Agent asks which story to implement
   - Include story file content to save dev agent lookup time
   - Dev follows tasks/subtasks, marking completion
   - Dev maintains File List of all changes
   - Dev marks story as "Review" when complete with all tests passing

   **Step 3 - Senior QA Review**:
   - **NEW CLEAN CHAT** â†’ `@qa` â†’ execute review-story task
   - QA performs senior developer code review
   - QA can refactor and improve code directly
   - QA appends results to story's QA Results section
   - If approved: Status â†’ "Done"
   - If changes needed: Status stays "Review" with unchecked items for dev

   **Step 4 - Repeat**: Continue SM â†’ Dev â†’ QA cycle until all epic stories complete

**Important**: Only 1 story in progress at a time, worked sequentially until all epic stories complete.

### Status Tracking Workflow

Stories progress through defined statuses:

- **Draft** â†’ **Approved** â†’ **InProgress** â†’ **Done**

Each status change requires user verification and approval before proceeding.

### Workflow Types

#### Greenfield Development

- Business analysis and market research
- Product requirements and feature definition
- System architecture and design
- Development execution
- Testing and deployment

#### Brownfield Enhancement (Existing Projects)

**Key Concept**: Brownfield development requires comprehensive documentation of your existing project for AI agents to understand context, patterns, and constraints.

**Complete Brownfield Workflow Options**:

**Option 1: PRD-First (Recommended for Large Codebases/Monorepos)**:

1. **Upload project to Gemini Web** (GitHub URL, files, or zip)
2. **Create PRD first**: `@pm` â†’ `*create-doc brownfield-prd`
3. **Focused documentation**: `@analyst` â†’ `*document-project`
   - Analyst asks for focus if no PRD provided
   - Choose "single document" format for Web UI
   - Uses PRD to document ONLY relevant areas
   - Creates one comprehensive markdown file
   - Avoids bloating docs with unused code

**Option 2: Document-First (Good for Smaller Projects)**:

1. **Upload project to Gemini Web**
2. **Document everything**: `@analyst` â†’ `*document-project`
3. **Then create PRD**: `@pm` â†’ `*create-doc brownfield-prd`
   - More thorough but can create excessive documentation

4. **Requirements Gathering**:
   - **Brownfield PRD**: Use PM agent with `brownfield-prd-tmpl`
   - **Analyzes**: Existing system, constraints, integration points
   - **Defines**: Enhancement scope, compatibility requirements, risk assessment
   - **Creates**: Epic and story structure for changes

5. **Architecture Planning**:
   - **Brownfield Architecture**: Use Architect agent with `brownfield-architecture-tmpl`
   - **Integration Strategy**: How new features integrate with existing system
   - **Migration Planning**: Gradual rollout and backwards compatibility
   - **Risk Mitigation**: Addressing potential breaking changes

**Brownfield-Specific Resources**:

**Templates**:

- `brownfield-prd-tmpl.md`: Comprehensive enhancement planning with existing system analysis
- `brownfield-architecture-tmpl.md`: Integration-focused architecture for existing systems

**Tasks**:

- `document-project`: Generates comprehensive documentation from existing codebase
- `brownfield-create-epic`: Creates single epic for focused enhancements (when full PRD is overkill)
- `brownfield-create-story`: Creates individual story for small, isolated changes

**When to Use Each Approach**:

**Full Brownfield Workflow** (Recommended for):

- Major feature additions
- System modernization
- Complex integrations
- Multiple related changes

**Quick Epic/Story Creation** (Use when):

- Single, focused enhancement
- Isolated bug fixes
- Small feature additions
- Well-documented existing system

**Critical Success Factors**:

1. **Documentation First**: Always run `document-project` if docs are outdated/missing
2. **Context Matters**: Provide agents access to relevant code sections
3. **Integration Focus**: Emphasize compatibility and non-breaking changes
4. **Incremental Approach**: Plan for gradual rollout and testing

**For detailed guide**: See `docs/working-in-the-brownfield.md`

## Document Creation Best Practices

### Required File Naming for Framework Integration

- `docs/prd.md` - Product Requirements Document
- `docs/architecture.md` - System Architecture Document

**Why These Names Matter**:

- Agents automatically reference these files during development
- Sharding tasks expect these specific filenames
- Workflow automation depends on standard naming

### Cost-Effective Document Creation Workflow

**Recommended for Large Documents (PRD, Architecture):**

1. **Use Web UI**: Create documents in web interface for cost efficiency
2. **Copy Final Output**: Save complete markdown to your project
3. **Standard Names**: Save as `docs/prd.md` and `docs/architecture.md`
4. **Switch to IDE**: Use IDE agents for development and smaller documents

### Document Sharding

Templates with Level 2 headings (`##`) can be automatically sharded:

**Original PRD**:

```markdown
## Goals and Background Context

## Requirements

## User Interface Design Goals

## Success Metrics
```

**After Sharding**:

- `docs/prd/goals-and-background-context.md`
- `docs/prd/requirements.md`
- `docs/prd/user-interface-design-goals.md`
- `docs/prd/success-metrics.md`

Use the `shard-doc` task or `@kayvan/markdown-tree-parser` tool for automatic sharding.

## Usage Patterns and Best Practices

### Environment-Specific Usage

**Web UI Best For**:
